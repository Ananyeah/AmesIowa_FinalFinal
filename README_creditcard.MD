## Domain Background
This dataset has information on credit line and payments for customers from Taiwan for a series of months.
The purpose of this data set is to explore and find the defaulters before they default.


## Problem Statement
The problem to solve is to find if a customer will default or not (Yes / No)
The strategy towards building the model would be this:

1. Reading, cleaning the data
2. Setting the categoricals / numericals
3. Scaling and transforming the data
4. EDA on the data to find the best predictors
5. Setting a benchmark
6. Running a classification model
7. Seeing how it performs

Metrics
In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you
will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These
calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the
problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this
section:
• Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models
clearly discussed and defined?
• Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on
the problem and solution?

Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the
problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input
data (or input files), or even an environment. Any abnormalities or interesting
qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified
(such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers).
Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
• Have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a
data sample been provided to the reader?
• Are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant
results from this calculation been discussed?
• Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or
dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values,
outliers, etc.)
Exploratory Visualization

In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that sum-
marizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The

visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this
visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when
writing this section:
• Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset
or input data?
• Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?
• If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?
Solution Statement
In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be
applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s)
given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that
the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or
logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and
clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs
more than once).
Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend
to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on

the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask
yourself when writing this section:
• Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters
in the project clearly defined?
• Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?
• Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the
algorithms and techniques chosen?
Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or
threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The
reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established
result) should be discussed. NOTE: This model should be fit and is the
only model fitting to be done for the proposal. Questions to ask yourself
when writing this section:
• Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for
measuring performance?
• Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by
hypothesis)?
Project Design
In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution
given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may
consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being
used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The
workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the

previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualiza-
tions, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is

not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of
the capstone project.
